 ```include image
size = 100
width = size * 3
height = size * 2
BR = rectangle(width,height,"solid","blue")
RR = rectangle(width,height,"solid","red")
WR = rectangle(width * 2,height * 2,"solid","white")
BR1 = place-image(BR,size,size / 2,WR)
RR1 = place-image(RR,size * 5,size / 2,BR1)
RR2 = place-image(RR,size,width + 50,RR1)
BR2 = place-image(BR,size * 5,width + 50,RR2)```

This is my attempt of programming the Dominican Republic flag so far. I'm still wondering if theres a way to combine all the 
rectangle functions (BR1,RR1,RR2,BR2) into one function. The most challenging part I have faced so far is programming all the 
rectangles onto the white rectangle. I couldn't figure out how to get all of them on the same white rectangle at first, as they
would keep going on seperate white rectangles, so I decided to make those BR1,RR1,RR2,BR2 functions and it made it a lot easier.
