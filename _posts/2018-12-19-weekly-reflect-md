## Flag of _Dominican Republic_ by _Sage Vega_

## Describe your program



In this program, I designed the flag for the Dominican Republic. I expect to get at least a 2 on this project.


## Current output

## Describe your process.

-   What questions, strategies, help from peers or teacher, or thinking got you to this point? _then delete this instruction_

I first defined the shapes I was going to use, then used functions to place the shapes to form the flag.

## Explain your code.
## Explain your code.
-   Choose a significant part of your program (15 lines max) and paste it below. Do not insert your entire program here. _then delete this instruction_
-   Explain each argument in the code section. _then delete this instruction_
-   Tell us how it functions independently and within the whole program _then delete this instruction_

```
size = 100
width = size * 3
height = size * 2
BR = rectangle(width,height,"solid","blue")
RR = rectangle(width,height,"solid","red")
WR = rectangle(width * 2,height * 2,"solid","white")
```

-   Explain the code you posted by telling us about each argument.
-   Then tell us how your code section fits into the whole.
 
This code here defines the blue, red, and white rectangles I used in the program.
