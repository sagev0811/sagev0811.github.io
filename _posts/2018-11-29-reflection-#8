The question I will analyze is question 2.
What is the name of the outermost function in scale(2, circle(40, "solid", "blue"))?
(a) scale       (b) circle     (c) rectangle      (d) contract
The question is asking to name the fuction that is outside of the parentheses.
It is associated with MS1 because it involves properties of expressions.
This is a novice level question because it requires naming surface level details.
The answer to this question is (a) scale because it is the function outside out of the parentheses.
Answer choice b is wrong because the circle function is in the parentheses.
Answer choice c is wrong because rectangle is not even in the question at all.
Answer choice d is wrong because there is no contract in the question.
People may have got this question wrong because they couldn't remember what an outermost fuction is.
