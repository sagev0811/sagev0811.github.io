## Flag of _Dominican Republic_ by _Sage Vega_

## Describe your program



In this program, I designed the flag for the Dominican Republic. I expect to get at least a 2 on this project.


## Current output



* * *
![Flag](/images/flag.png)
* * *

## Describe your process.


I first defined the shapes I used, then used the place-image function to put those shapes together to form the flag.

â€‹



## Explain your code.


I made rectangle functions using the previously defined functions for the width and height. BR is for the blue rectangles in the flag, RR is for the red rectangles, and WR is the white rectangle that makes the background of the flag.
* * *

```
size = 100
width = size * 3
height = size * 2
BR = rectangle(width,height,"solid","blue")
RR = rectangle(width,height,"solid","red")
WR = rectangle(width * 2,height * 2,"solid","white")
```
