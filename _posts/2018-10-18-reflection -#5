This week we were assigned to make a flag of our choice. I chose the indonesia flag. I did this by defining "RR" to be a solid red 
rectangle with a height of 300 and a width of 200. Next, I defined "WR" to be a solid white rectangle with a height of 300 and a width of 
100. Finally, I used the "place-image function" to place WR on the bottom half of RR and got my flag.
