This week we learned about contracts for functions. A contract is a guide on how a function is supposed to work. A contract usually
includes 3 parts. The first part being the name of the function. It's what you want to call the function. You can name a function
whatever you want, but you usually want a name that reflects what the function does. The second part of a contract is the domain. The
domain is what the function expects. It contains the types of data the function uses to do its job. Some examples are numbers and strings.
Finally, the last part of a function is the range. The range is what the function produces. It contains the type of data that the function
returns when given the domain. I learned that contracts are very helpful when defining functions because it gives you a better idea of what
the function does and makes it easier to use.
